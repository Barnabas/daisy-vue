# Daisy Vue

Daisy Vue is a library of component templates for Vue or Nuxt projects using [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/), a Tailwind plugin of opinionated components.
If you have a Vue or Nuxt project that already is configured to use daisyUI, copy the components from the src/components directory and customize them as needed.

## Requirements

* Vue >= 3.5
* Tailwind >= 4
* daisyUI >= 5

## Demo

Run the dev server  from the command line:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

Then visit http://localhost:5173.
